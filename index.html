	  <h1>Welcome to the era of the lone book creator</h1>
	  <aside class='notes'>Kindle direct publishing and other
    platforms like LeanPub, SmashWords have allowed the writer to
    bypass the editorial and self-publish whatever you do. Same as the programmer can
    nowadays just put something up for grabs in GitHub or
    wherever. That only means that you have to fend for yourself all
	    the way through the writing and publications
	    process.</aside>

	    <blockquote>[The Analytical Engine] ...might act upon other things besides numbers</blockquote>
	    <p class='quote'>Augusta Ada King (Née Byron), countess of Lovelace</p>
	    
	    <aside class='notes'>Besides <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace#Beyond_numbers'>casting
		the computer as an universal machine</a>, it's quite clear
	      that there is no big difference between numbers and anything
	      else, as long as you can express them symbolically and their
	      relationship algebraically. There is something about this
	      in Sydney's Paduas graphic novel where Ada Lovelace programs the
	      analytical engine so that it checks "books" and rips apart
	      those that do not conform to a standard. A bit of this in
	      <a href='http://sydneypadua.com/2dgoggles/author-author/'>this
		blog post.</a>. So theoretically you could think about
		flights of fancy like using text generators, or text
		"fillers" or any other kind of helpers for the
		particular dialog style, or book atmosphere, or
		whatever. Word completion? CTags? Writer's block
		button? However, we are not going to go there except
		to say that the more tools you need to use, the
		easiest will be to put everything into a LitOps
		cycle. </aside>

	    <aside class='notes'>More than enough for non technical
	      books, quite adequate for technical books. Markdown is
	      important, because it gives structure to the
	      code. That's the joke Saint Mark's Dom... MarkDOM, it
	      creates a DOM for the manuscript. This is the worst
	      joke you're ever gonna hear today. </aside>
