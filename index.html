	  <h1>Welcome to the era of the lone book creator</h1>
	  <aside class='notes'>Kindle direct publishing and other
    platforms like LeanPub, SmashWords have allowed the writer to
    bypass the editorial and self-publish. Same as the programmer can
    nowadays just put something up for grabs in GitHub or
    wherever. That only means that you have to fend for yourself all
	    the way through the writing and publications
	    process.</aside>

	  <aside class='notes'>And this is a whole series, inclusing
	  Amish Vampires from Space, Amish Zombies from Space, and the
	    thing about kittens is a fake, but plausible. Of course we can't say that it's not the best cover for the title. Amish ✓ Kittens ✓ Space ✓ </aside>

	  <aside class='notes'>Writing is so much like software development, and I already said so <a href='https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/five-reasons-why-writing-is-so-much-like-software-development-6d154a43719c'>a long time ago</a>.

	  <blockquote>[The Analytical Engine] ...might act upon other things besides number</blockquote>
	  <p class='quote'>Augusta Ada King (Née Byron), countess of Lovelace</p>

	  <aside class='notes'>Besides <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace#Beyond_numbers'>casting
	  the computer as an universal machine</a>, it's quite clear
	  that there is no big difference between numbers and anything
	  else, as long as you can express them symbolically and their
	    relationship algebraically. There is something about this
	  in Sydney's Paduas novel where Ada Lovelace programs the
	  analytical engine so that it checks "books" and rips apart
	  those that do not conform to a standard. A bit of this in
	  <a href='http://sydneypadua.com/2dgoggles/author-author/'>this
	    blog post.</a></aside>
